# How to Contribute

Welcome! This document explains some of the ways you can contribute to the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics' LaTeX style files.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Raise Issues

Whether it's about the documentation or the package, you can raise issues in the normal way via [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). Please [open via a template](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/issues/new/choose) and check nobody else has opened a [similar issue](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before submitting.

Be aware that changes you make to the stylesheets and docs will be released under the [LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lppl-1.3c/) and any changes to the examples will be released under the [BSD Zero Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/).

## Contribute LaTeX

Anyone is welcome to [submit pull requests](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/compare) with fixes or additions to the style files and the associated templates. When making changes, please aim to keep backwards compatibility; these style files have been used for over a decade, so we want to keep breakage of past documents to an absolute minimum. Please use the pull request template provided and flag if the changes introduced may break backwards compatibility.

If what you've done will require changes to the documentation and/or example files, please include that too or flag that it will need doing in the pull request. These are compiled automatically by GitHub actions so PDF outputs should not be included in the commits.

## Improve Documentation

If you think the documentation ([report](https://foggalong.github.io/edinburgh-math-latex/edmaths-docs.pdf), [beamer](https://foggalong.github.io/edinburgh-math-latex/beamertheme-edmaths-docs.pdf)) can be improved, you're more than welcome to submit a pull request for that too! The docs are compiled automatically by GitHub actions so PDF outputs should not be included in the commits.

If anything in the docs is unclear but you're not sure what needs changing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/issues/new?labels=documentation&template=documentation.md) and include as much detail about the problem as possible.
