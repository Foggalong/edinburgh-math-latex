# How to Contribute

Welcome! This document explains some of the ways you can contribute to the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics' LaTeX style files.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Raise Issues

Whether it's about the documentation or the package, you can raise issues in the normal way via [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). Please [open via a template](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/issues/new/choose) and check nobody else has opened a [similar issue](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before submitting.

## Contribute LaTeX

Anyone is welcome to [submit pull requests](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/compare) with fixes or additions to the style files and the associated templates. When making changes please aim to keep backwards compatibility; these style files have been used for over a decade, so we want to keep breakage of past documents to an absolute minimum. Please use the pull request template provided and flag if the changes introduced may break backwards compatibility.

Be aware that changes you make to the style files will be released under the [LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lppl-1.3c/) and any changes to the examples will be released under the [BSD Zero Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/).

## Improve Documentation

Aside from the main [README file](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/blob/main/README.md) which anyone can submit changes to, additional [documentation](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/wiki) is hosted using GitHub wikis which unfortunately do not support [pull requests](https://stackoverflow.com/q/10642928). To submit an improvement or change to the wiki, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex/issues/new?labels=documentation&template=documentation.md) and include the markdown for what you would like to be included.
